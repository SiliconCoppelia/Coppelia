# Silicon Coppélia
Silicon Coppélia is a software for making robots response affectively to other agents.
This project aims to cope with the number produced by Coppélia during the affection/emotion processing process and make Coppélia talks by applying NLP.  

# Installation
The project is still in its development phase. Source code and README files will be updated periodically

# To-Do
- [x] The first tasks will be **mapping the numbers to a pool of fix sentences**
- [x]  ~~Audio sound to read out the output string(TTS)~~(This function is currently disabled)  
- [x]  Implement version 2 with new model and detailed reasoning between the input features and the output sentence  
- Version 2:  
- [x]  CHEN Yi pu: Modify the abstract class, Use Intention, and the main function
- [x]  Yooki: Modify Relevance class, Valence class, Involvement, and Distance
- [x]  Anthony: Ethics and Affordance class  
- Version 3:  
- [x] Main, Affordance, and UseIntension Matrix: Tommy
- [x] Involvement and Distance Matrix: Yooki
- [x] Relevance and Valance: Anthony
- Version 4:  
- [ ] Move back from simple NLP, focus on simple structures
